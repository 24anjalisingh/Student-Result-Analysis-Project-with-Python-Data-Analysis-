# Student Result Analysis Project

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to evaluate trends in Math, Reading, and Writing scores based on demographic factors.

## Key Steps
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: handled missing values, removed irrelevant columns, standardized categorical features (e.g., Weekly Study Hours)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): examined relationships between Gender, Ethnic Group, Parent Education, Parent Marital Status, and Study Hours with student scores
- Aggregation & Analysis: calculated mean scores across different categories using groupby operations
- Data Visualization: created count plots, box plots, heatmaps, and pie charts to identify score distribution patterns
- Insights: identified that higher parental education correlates with improved student performance, while marital status has negligible impact

## Outcome
- Generated actionable insights on academic performance trends
- Applied Python data analysis and visualization skills to interpret and present findings effectively
